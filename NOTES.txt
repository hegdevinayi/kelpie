[[ Finite-displacement Phonon Module ]]

NOW:
- Phonopy an optional dependency (plug-in) for kelpie
- Symmetrize the POSCAR into the Niggli-reduced cell (most isotropic)
- Use phonopy to generate supercells with atomic displacements
- PhononCalculation workflow that:
  - takes as input all the displaced supercells
  - performs static calculation for each to get forces
- Use phonopy to calculate FCs, phonon frequencies, eigenvectors and other
  derivate quantities

LATER:
- Non-analytical term correction near G?
- Quasi-harmonic phonons?
